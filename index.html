        </div>
        <p>
            Safari is a girl with the kindest heart I've ever known. There's something incredibly warm about the
            way you carry yourself—always thoughtful, always ready to help, and never too busy to listen. doesn’t. The
            way you smiles when you talk
            about the things you love (including me), or how you know your way with words—always comforting me or giving
            advice on various topics, those little moments stick
            with me. I love you so much—not in some dramatic, over-the-top way, but in that quiet, constant way where
            you are just always on my mind.Just being around you makes me feel better about myself, and honestly, I
            wouldn’t trade that feeling
            for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the fact that we knew each other towards the end of 2024 and you remember you hated me and all
            because you thought i was datig your cousin.I remember asking Tilan about you trying to get to know you
            better since i was afraid to talk to you myself.But I think I have told you this story a lot of times.Well
            the whole point of it is to shown you how much interesting you are to me and how much I wanted to know you
            better and be close to you.I also was stunned by your beauty and not only physically but also the fact that
            you are well mannered and have strong faith.Those are some of the things I find attractive about you—not
            forgetting your kind heart and you always being there for me.
            I really hope that things work out and we—you know end up gettig somewhere far.
        </p>

            Just to be completely honest, i think this is the furthest I've ever gone in a relationship. I mean, I’ve
            never really been in a serious relationship before.By furthest I mean, I’vealready met your brother and some
            of your closest friends and also some relatives of mine know you.I just want you to know i wouldn’t want to
            give this—what we are starting—away.
            There might be many ups or downs but despite of any obstacles i want you to know that i will always be there
            for you.
